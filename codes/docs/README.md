# 🤖 Agentome

**Agentome** is a framework for simulating and deploying intelligent networks of agents (physical or virtual) that operate as a **quantum-synchronized graph**. It enables multiple agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt using both **phase-synchronization mechanisms** and **LLM-assisted natural language reasoning**.

## 🌐 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 Agents | Nodes representing autonomous units (sensors, robots, LLMs) |
| 🔗 Quantum Graph | Edges represent phase-coherent links for real-time communication |
| 🔄 Synchronization Engine | Maintains harmonic alignment across the network |
| 🗣️ LLM Communication | Enables semantic reasoning and language-based interaction |
| 🛰️ Use Case | Smart surveillance networks, multi-agent drones, distributed cognition |
